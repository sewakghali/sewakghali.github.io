        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Sewak Singh Gill. I am currently a Computer Science student
          at Seneca College. I am very good at programming in C/C++ and
          JavaScript and begining to get better at python as well. My fields of
          interests other than computers are Physics, Mathematics, Robotics,
          Mechanics and Electronics. I aspire to combine all of these into
          building a robot of my own one day. But for now, I will stick to game
          development and web development.

        <h4>High School</h4>
        <h4>2018-2021</h4>
        <p>
          My high school records are excellent. I studied at Akal Academy
          Puranewala, Moga, a high school in India. I scored 95.6% marks in 10th
          grade. I then opted for Non-Medical stream for the last two years'
          study at high school and managed to score 89.2% marks overall. My
          hobby of reading is what has made me successful at academics.

        <h4>2022-Present</h4>
        <p>
          After graduating from high school in 2021, I decided to move abroad
          for further studies, and here I am, pursuing an advanced diploma in
          Computer Programming and Analysis. Moving to Canada has proved to be
          very good decision as I have now the opportunites to learn in a
          multicultural environment, and thrive in increased exposure.

        <h4>Game Developer</h4>
        <p>
          Game development is my stepping stone in the world of computers.
          Before 2019, I had no interest in software programming or anyhting
          related to it. But then I saw the Unreal Engine 4 demos after watching
          its trademark from the popular battle royale game, PUBG mobile. I was
          so impressed by the feats of UE4 that I decided to learn game
          development. My finished projects include a 2D platformer game and a
          3rd person offline shooter game.
        </p>

      <div id="Cdev">
        <h4>C/C++ Developer</h4>
        <p>
          After learning the basics of UE4, I decided to learn C++, the language
          in which UE4 is coded. As of now, I am leaning C++ in my college too
          which is super fun. I have built numerous programs in C/C++, assigned
          to me by the professor and I have achieved very good results.
        </p>

      <div id="webDev">
        <h4>Front-End Web Developer</h4>
        <p>
          The front-end development is my first step in the world of
          web-development. My profiency at this activity can be seen from this
          website. I aspire to be a full-stack developer one day, but I still
          need to do some work on my web-development skills.
